### Sarah's Ultimate Challenge: Word Rush Training
Sarah, a brilliant young coder with dreams bigger than her small apartment, clutched her brand-new smartphone with trembling fingers. Just yesterday, she'd bought it with money saved from countless coding projects. After excitedly texting all her friends about her purchase, she discovered something that would change everything
Scrolling through a coding forum, a glowing advertisement caught her eye:
"Ultimate Word Contest – $50,000 Cash Prize!"
The challenge was simple yet daunting—unscramble words faster than anyone else in the world.
"I can do this," Sarah whispered, her coder's logic kicking in. Words were just patterns, and patterns were her specialty.
She registered immediately. Round after round, Sarah's analytical mind dissected each scrambled word with surgical precision. RATEC became CRATE. NHTIG transformed into NIGHT. Her coding background had trained her to see patterns where others saw chaos. Now, she stood at the threshold of the finals. Her opponent? Julie Martinez—the five-time consecutive champion, a legend who could unscramble words faster than most people could read them.
Sarah needed to train. She needed to be perfect.
That’s where you come in—Sarah’s best friend, ready to give her the edge. You decide to build the ultimate training app:

## Word Rush
Word Rush is a high-speed word puzzle game where players must unscramble 4- to 5-letter words against the clock. Each round challenges the player to identify the correct word from a random set of letters within a limited time, typically 20 to 30 seconds. Success means moving on to the next scramble; failure—whether by mistake or timeout—ends the streak.
The goal is simple: solve as many words as possible, as quickly as possible, and set the highest score. With each correct answer, the pressure builds, pushing reflexes and vocabulary to the limit.
To beat a champion like Julie, Sarah needs more than talent—she needs training. And with Word Rush, she just might have a fighting chance.
